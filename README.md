BrainStation: BrainFlix Project

This React/Node.js project was created during the course of three weeks at the Web Development Program (Spring Cohort 2020) at BrainStation.

On the Sprint 1: I had to create a functioning and responsive app prototype from the project designs provided.

On the Sprint 2: I had to enhance what was built in Sprint 1 by creating different routes.

On the Sprint 3: I had to use the mock API as guide to build out my own API service that will manage the video data, and update the client application to use the API service.
